	<p class="panel_header">Panel One</p>
	<p><img class="panel_img" alt="" src="panel_one.jpg" /></p>
	<p class="panel_description">The first panel is responsible for selecting the appropriate files to 
	schedule the exams. The buttons labelled 'Exam File', 'Room File' and 
	'Professor File' all open a file selector dialog when clicked. Once all 
	three of the files have been chosen the user is ready to move on and should 
	click the 'Continue' button as depicted in the bottom-right corner.</p>
	<hr class="light_line"/>
	
	<p class="panel_header">Panel Two</p>
	<p><img class="panel_img" alt="" src="panel_two.jpg" /></p>
	<p class="panel_description">The second panel is responsible for verifying 
	the three input files selected in panel one. The three status labels 'Exam 
	file status', 'Room file status' and 'Professor file status' will indicate 
	if there is a problem with any of the files. If the three statuses all 
	return okay then the user should again click the 'Continue' button.</p>
	<hr class="light_line"/>

	<p class="panel_header">Panel Three</p>
	<p><img class="panel_img" alt="" src="panel_three.jpg" /></p>
	<p class="panel_description">The third panel does the scheduling of the 
	exams, the three labels indicate when the scheduling began, the estimated 
	time remaining (approximation) and the current elapsed running time. The 
	'Pause' button located above the 'Continue' button allows the user to halt 
	(and resume) the scheduling of the exams. Once the scheduling is complete 
	the 'Continue' button will become clickable once again and should be clicked 
	to move onto the final panel.</p>
	<hr class="light_line"/>
	
	<p class="panel_header">Panel Four</p>
	<p><img class="panel_img" alt="" src="panel_four.jpg" /></p>
	<p class="panel_description">The final panel displays the scheduled exam and 
	its properties; the starting and ending date for the exam period, the length 
	of the exam period (in days), the number of exam conflicts that exist in the 
	schedule and the number of people with three consecutive exams. Below the 
	scheduled exam panel there are two buttons; 'View' and 'Save'. The 'View' 
	button opens the schedule to be viewed, and the 'Save' button allows the 
	user to save the schedule in a desired format when pressed. When finished 
	viewing and/or saving the schedule, the 'Finish' button in the bottom right 
	will exit the program.</p>
